# React Social Icons

A collection of React components for social media icons, designed for easy integration into your React projects. This library provides optimized SVG components for popular social platforms.

## Features

- **React Components:** Each social icon is a self-contained React component.
- **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG):** Icons are rendered as SVGs, ensuring high-quality visuals on all screen sizes.
- **Customizable:** Supports attributes like `width`, `height`, `fill`, and `className` for customization.
- **Optimized SVGs:** Icons are processed with [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) for minimal file sizes without losing quality.
